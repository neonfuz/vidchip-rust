* Types of stream (in typical game)
** Backend to Frontend
*** resource loading
   - load resources upon entering scene
   - can't use other resources
     - limit this to disallow bad practice of trying to load resources
       exactly as they are needed, possibly causing IO issues
*** State transfer
 - state of objects, to be drawn by frontend
 - stream can be compressed with diff, delta, regular compression, etc
** Frontend to Backend
*** Input
 - local and network?
** Other
*** full game state?
 - could generate other streams based on this
* IPC strategies
 - C IPC (rust?)
   - too similar to just using sdl directly
 - sqlite
   - can do read only? (might be viable)
   - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14032711/data-sharing-sqlite-vs-shared-memory-ipc
 - protobuf
   - fifo
     - pointless encoding and decoding with little benefit (can't even
       diff objects easily, unlike sqlite)
