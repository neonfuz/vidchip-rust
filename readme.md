Vidchip-Rust
============

Rust version of vidchip, a simple graphics drawing interface for
games. Initially it will be a rust port of the current version of
vidchip, but eventually it will extend beyond this
functionality. Right now this is what I'm planning

1. Clone current c vidchip
2. Implement protobuf support
